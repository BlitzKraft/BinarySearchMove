### Custom keybindings 

Move a cursor with binary search principle - each step is twice shorter than previous.
This requires log2(N) steps in a worth case to position in a line with a length N (7 keypresses for a 120 chars line).

left/right movement are bound to H and L
up/down to <Leader>u and <Leader>d
